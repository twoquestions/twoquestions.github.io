WebGL, OpenGL, Math in general, Art in general, Algorithms, Linux, Emacs, Game 
Programming, Game Design, Parkour, Fencing.  All of these things I want to 
learn, but any one of them can take up a whole year in themselves to even 
scratch the surface.  Not to mention spending time with people that I care 
about, and actually playing video games so I don't become a complete robot
who lives only to produce!

Other than that, I've going thorugh Handmade Hero to try to tackle a few of the
above all at the same time, even if Casey codes at lightspeed.  Slowly but
surely getting a stronger grip on C again.  It's been a long time since school.
