title:  "MUST DO ART!"

In addition to exercise, creating (not doing, creating) something purely
for asthetic value is important.  Delve too deeply purely into function instead
of form, and you'll be tempted to cut off every bit of you that isn't function,
like love or companionship, and you'll start to wonder what you're even doing 
here.

Gotta get back drawing again.  Gotta see what the world could be, rather than
just how it is.
