Now that I've done some thinking, I think I'll focus on C dev with 
Handmade Hero and Web dev with my Canvas Roguelike game. Everything else looks
like it'l take more time to get good at, and making games is my biggest passion
anyway.  Best to let my passion guide me rather than trying to force myself to
study something in between times it catches my eye.

I'll try to keep up with my drawing, perhaps a half hour each day or so, 
starting next week.  I've gotten in the habit of contributing to Github every 
day; It barely feels like work anymore.  

All I really have to do is resist the urge to over-engineer the Canvas game.  
After all, premature optimization is the root of all evil!
