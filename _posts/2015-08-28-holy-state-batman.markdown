Just started making my HTML Roguelike game, and the crazy modifications to state
are already killing me.  Keeping everything straight is not going to be fun, so 
I think I'll learn ClojureScript and use that before I get eaten by the same 
thing that eats all other game devs.

The big trouble with games is that they have an unholy shit-ton of state that 
changes quickly, and players (like me) expect it all to be on the screen, all 
the time, so hiding all of this state changing is really tough.

I also want to learn how to use Emacs, because I can already use vi from my 
BGSU education, and I wasn't really enamored with it.  I fell in love 
immediately with lisp, and it seems everyone who writes lisp uses emacs 
anyway.  Weekend project, HOOOOO!
