#Economic Patriotism

A friend of mine posted about how the $15 minimum wage would be both expensive and ineffective in addressing poverty, and the comment thread concluded how poverty in the US isn't that big of a deal anyway, because many of our mutual friends endured poverty themselves.

Instead of repeating already broken arguments or chastising people for their lack of compassion, I'm going to argue why every American having a decent quality of life is best for all of us, even those of us who are already comfortable.  

##Problem Definition

One thing I noticed was how people disagreed even on what the problem *is*,much less how to solve it, so I'll be explicit on what the issue is here.  

The price of labor (wages), is lower than the cost of labor (mostly housing, food, education, and transportation).  The reason for this is because the poor (and increasingly middle-class) lack the negotiating power necessary to improve their lot.  While a hike in the minimum wage would give some people negotiating power (pay me at least $minimum or there will be legal consequences), it doesn't do as much for people just above the minimum wage,and it has an increased negative impact on smaller and lower-margin businesses.

What we need to do in order to fix this problem is both increase all worker's negotiating power in general, not just the very lowest, and work harder to control the price of the necessities mentioned earlier.  

##Costs 

###Housing

The housing market is all different kinds of messed up.  Right now, there are more vacant homes than homeless people, which is sounds absolutely absurd. I can understand why a bank or private investor may want to hold out on selling or renting out a property for fear of missing out on a better price later, but holding out to this point is doing more social harm than private good.  

To solve this, in places where there is both a significant surplus of homes and homeless people, the government should be empowered to buy those homes at just under market price and put them to use housing people, as Utah has with already government-owned property.  We also need to give tax privileges to multifamily home construction, especially in cities where space is at a  premium.  Luckily that trend has already started to materialize.

###Food

The second major spending category among all people is food.  It isn't just the cost of food that drags people down, it's the types of food that's both available and cheap.  When people talk about how to shop cheap, they  generally say to buy "rice and beans", which will keep you in adequate calories and protein, it won't give you all the nutrients you need in order to be at your best.  The poor are hit hardest by both the need to save money on food, and the need to not slack on nutrition, as they have less leeway at work if they get sick or injured.

There's also a problem of food deserts in the poorest areas of the country,  that is areas without a grocery store within reach of the people's homes.  What is available instead is bad sugar/carbohydrate/fat heavy foods that are much more calorie dense than they are nutritious.  These forces among others are what contributes to our obesity problems for everybody.

To solve this, we need to modify our food subsidies to favor local fresh fruit and vegetables, to save both local farmers and consumers of food transportation costs.   We already give people money for food which is good,  but that won't do much good if they have nowhere to buy good food.

Also, I'd recommend watching John Oliver's video about food waste, as he  describes the causes and consequences much better than I do.

###Education

Education is often said to be the be-all-end-all cure to poverty, and for many it is, but there's major problems for how we deliver it.

Right now, we loan money at about 6%-9% interest, depending on the type of the loan and when the student borrows.  That loan can never be discharged with bankruptcy, only by very specific public service programs that aren't available to most.  Either that, or the GI Bill, which not everyone can serve in the military.  

However, everyone benefits from the work that college-educated people do, and it's both strange and unfair that the people who try to better themselves are subject to what amounts to an extra tax due to the interest on these student loans, which gets worse if the student had difficulties or had to change majors.  

Furthermore, not everyone who gets a degree gets a better job, even for more economically friendly degrees like engineering or computer science.  This lack of certainty drives otherwise good students away from furthering their education, adverse to the risk of loans that can't be discharged.

What we should do instead is subject everybody who wants to go to college to an aptitude test, and then tuition (and tuition only) is paid by the state at state-supported colleges, provided the student keeps good grades.  Housing should not be subsidized extra for students, but students should be able to take classes slowly so they can both learn the material and have time to work in order to keep a roof over their head.

##Why do all this?

No doubt the policies I outlined above will be expensive, and if the status quo is not that awful, why should we raise taxes enough to pay for all this?

###National Pride

Whenever I go to comment threads about the US in other countries, they're always surprised by the number of homeless and poor in the supposedly richest country in the world.  This makes us look more like That Guy who parks his $50,000 vehicle next to his $5,000 dwelling.  What's to prove that we're as powerful as we think we are if we're too weak to provide for everybody?

###Economic Voice

If there are more people simply subsisting than actually participating economically, we'll lose our economic voice on the world stage.  Why sell to a bunch of people too poor to buy anything?

###Private Command Economy

This is the thing I'm most afraid of.  I'm afraid that not-super-rich people will be by and large not powerful enough to support an industry on their own.  Look at Silicon Valley, where instead of building new industries everyone's using VC money to grow as fast as possible, then find some other sucker to buy their share of the company.

Another example is the Oculus Rift, which was Kickstarted and had John Carmack on staff, but they still needed to sell to Facebook to get the resources they needed.  

Command economies make bad decisions, because there's few points of failure (among other reasons), and a private command economy is little better than a state command economy.
